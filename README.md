# Distributed Systems - 2nd Project
## Room to share files


This is a small project for the Distributed Systems Course which consisted of creating a platform that allows its users to create private rooms to share content with their friends.
After the register, a user must invite his/her friends to start sharing.



This project was developed using node.js and jade for backend and frontend respectively.
